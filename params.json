{"name":"formd","body":"# [`formd`](https://github.com/drbunsen/formd)&mdash;A Markdown formatting tool:\r\n\r\n`formd` is a tool for (for)matting (M)ark(d)own that allows rapid conversion between the [two styles](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link) of Markdown links and images&mdash;_inline_ and _referenced_. \r\n\r\n## Why is `formd` useful?   \r\n\r\nInline Markdown is difficult to read, but useful for writing and editing because the linked text and URLs are adjacent to the words you are writing. For example:\r\n```markdown\r\nThe quick brown [fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox) jumped over \r\nthe lazy [dog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog).\r\n```\r\nReferenced Markdown is awkward while writing because it requires jumping between links within the text and the reference section at the bottom of a document. However, referenced Markdown is the superior syntax for reading because URLs do not breakup the flow of words or sentences. For example:\r\n```markdown\r\nThe quick brown [fox][] jumped over the lazy [dog][].  \r\n```\r\n`formd` provides the best of both worlds by allowing users to quickly toggle Markdown formats between inline while writing and referenced while reading. `formd` reads and writes to [standard streams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams), so it can be adapted to a wide-range of user workflows. See [this blog post](http://www.drbunsen.org/markdown-formatting/) for further details and workflow examples for using `formd` on the command line, with [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), or with [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/).\r\n\r\n## Dependencies:\r\nPython 2.7+\r\n\r\n## Installation:\r\nClone `formd` and place it somewhere in your path:\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/drbunsen/formd.git ~/bin/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage  \r\nThere are two command line options for `formd`:  \r\n\r\nTo generate referenced Markdown use the `-r` flag:  \r\n```bash\r\n$ formd -r\r\n``` \r\nTo generate inline Markdown use the `-i` flag:  \r\n```bash\r\n$ formd -i \r\n```\r\n\r\n`formd` is designed to work with a wide variety of workflows. Here are a few examples:  \r\n\r\n#### Use from the command line: \r\n```bash\r\n$ cat ugly_markdown_file.md | formd -r > reference_formatted_file.md\r\n```  \r\n\r\n#### Use within Vim:  \r\n```vim\r\n:%! formd -r\r\n```\r\nor add mappings to your `.vimrc`:\r\n```vim\r\nnmap <leader>fr :%! ~/bin/formd -r<CR>\r\nnmap <leader>fi :%! ~/bin/formd -i<CR>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Use as a stand alone shell script on with [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/) on OS X:  \r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash\r\npbpaste | ~/bin/formd -r\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information on `formd` see [this blog post](http://www.drbunsen.org/markdown-formatting/) for additional usage examples and a video demonstration.\r\n\r\nHave questions, comments, or suggestions about `formd`?
